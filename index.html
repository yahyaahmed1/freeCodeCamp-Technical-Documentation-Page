          Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This
          chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration
          statements available to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where
          you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in
          another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be
          expressed this way as a loop:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>
            for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) { <br />
            // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4. <br />
            console.log('Walking east one step'); <br />
            }
          </code>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="for_statement">
        <header>for_statement</header>
        <p>
          A <span class="special-word">for</span> loop repeats until a specified
          condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript
          <span class="special-word">for</span> loop is similar to the Java and
          C <span class="special-word">for</span> loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <span class="special-word">for</span> statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>
            for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression];
            [incrementExpression]) { <br />
            statement <br />
            }
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          When a <span class="special-word">for</span> loop executes, the
          following occurs:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The initializing expression
            <span class="special-word">initialExpression</span>, if any, is
            executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop
            counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of
            complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <span class="special-word">conditionExpression</span> expression
            is evaluated. If the value of
            <span class="special-word">conditionExpression</span> is true, the
            loop statements execute. Otherwise, the
            <span class="special-word">for</span> loop terminates. (If the
            <span class="special-word">conditionExpression</span> expression is
            omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)
          </li>
          <li>
            The <span class="special-word">statement</span> executes. To execute
            multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those
            statements.
          </li>
          <li>
            If present, the update expression
            <span class="special-word">incrementExpression</span> is executed.
          </li>
          <li>Control returns to Step 2.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="do...while_statement">
        <header>do...while_statement</header>
        <p>
          The <span class="special-word">do...while</span> statement repeats
          until a specified condition evaluates to false.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <span class="special-word">do...while</span> statement looks as
          follows:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>
            do <br />
            statement <br />
            while (condition);
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          <span class="special-word">statement</span> is always executed once
          before the condition is checked. (To execute multiple statements, use
          a block statement ({ }) to group those statements.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="special-word">if</span> condition is
          <span class="special-word">true</span>, the statement executes again.
          At the end of every execution, the condition is checked. When the
          condition is <span class="special-word">false</span>, execution stops,
          and control passes to the statement following
          <span class="special-word">do...while</span>.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <h1>Example</h1>
          <p>
            In the following example, the
            <span class="special-word">do</span> loop iterates at least once and
            reiterates until <span class="special-word">i</span> is no longer
            less than <span class="special-word">5</span>.
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              let i = 0; <br />
              do { <br />
              i += 1; <br />
              console.log(i); <br />
              } while (i < 5);
            </code>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while_statement</header>
        <p>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>
            while (condition) <br />
            statement
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          If the <span class="special-word">condition</span> becomes
          <span class="special-word">false</span>,
          <span class="special-word">statement</span> within the loop stops
          executing and control passes to the statement following the loop
        </p>
        <p>
          The condition test occurs before
          <span class="special-word">statement</span> in the loop is executed.
          If the condition returns <span class="special-word">true</span>,
          <span class="special-word">statement</span> is executed and the
          <span class="special-word">condition</span> is tested again. If the
          condition returns <span class="special-word">false</span>, execution
          stops, and control is passed to the statement following
          <span class="special-word">while</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group
          those statements.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <h1>Example</h1>
          <p>
            The following <span class="special-word">while</span> loop iterates
            as long as <span class="special-word">n</span> is less than
            <span class="special-word">3</span>:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              let n = 0; <br />
              let x = 0; <br />
              while (n < 3) { <br />
              n++; <br />
              x += n; <br />
              }
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            With each iteration, the loop increments
            <span class="special-word">n</span> and adds that value to
            <span class="special-word">x</span>. Therefore,
            <span class="special-word">x</span> and
            <span class="special-word">n</span> take on the following values:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After the first pass: <span class="special-word">n = 1</span> and
              <span class="special-word">x = 1</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              After the second pass: <span class="special-word">n = 2</span> and
              <span class="special-word">x = 3</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              After the third pass: <span class="special-word">n = 3</span> and
              <span class="special-word">x = 6</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After completing the third pass, the condition
            <span class="special-word">n < 3</span> is no longer
            <span class="special-word">true</span>, so the loop terminates.
